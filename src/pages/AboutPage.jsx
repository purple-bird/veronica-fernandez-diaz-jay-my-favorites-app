    <p>
      My name is Veronica and I created this project. As someone who often
      forgets about favorite things I enjoyed at different points in life, I
      wanted to find a way to gather items I enjoy. This is why I created this
      app to be able to save that data, categorize it, and even reorder it as I
      add more items. Even if this is not used long-term, it could be fun
      exercise to do in one sitting.
